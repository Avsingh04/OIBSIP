# Nikto Vulnerability Scan — Guide & Results Analysis

## Objective
Use Nikto to perform a vulnerability scan on a web server, analyze results, and identify potential security issues.

## Tools
- Nikto (https://cirt.net/Nikto2)
- curl (for target verification)
- Optional: SSL Labs, CVE databases

## Responsible use
Only scan systems you own or are explicitly authorized to test. Unauthorized scanning is illegal and unethical.

## Steps (concise)
1. Install Nikto (Debian / Kali)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nikto -y
nikto -Version
```
2. Verify target reachable
```bash
curl -I http://TARGET_HOST:PORT
```
3. Run a scan and save results
```bash
nikto -h http://TARGET_HOST -o nikto_results.txt -Format txt
# Verbose:
nikto -h http://TARGET_HOST -Display V -o nikto_results.txt -Format txt
# HTML / XML output:
nikto -h http://TARGET_HOST -o nikto_results.html -Format html
nikto -h http://TARGET_HOST -o nikto_results.xml -Format xml
```
4. Use tuning to reduce noise
```bash
nikto -h http://TARGET_HOST -Tuning 1,2
```

## Example (DVWA in Docker)
```bash
# Start DVWA (example)
docker run -d --name dvwa -p 8080:80 vulnerables/web-dvwa
# Verify from scanner
curl -I http://host.docker.internal:8080
# Run Nikto from scanner/container
nikto -h http://host.docker.internal:8080 -o /root/nikto_scan_dvwa.txt -Format txt -Display V
```

## Analysis workflow
1. Record metadata: target, date/time, nikto version, command used, scanned IP.  
2. Triage: remove false positives, group by severity and exploitability.  
3. Cross-reference: map findings to CVEs / vendor advisories.  
4. Validate: manually verify high/critical issues safely (non-destructive).  
5. Remediate & retest: assign owners, schedule fixes, re-scan to confirm.

## Analysis: sample findings (from nikto_scan_results.txt)
Source file: f:\OIBSIP\7.Vulnerability_Scanning_Nikto\nikto_scan_results.txt

- Multiple IPs returned (CDN): expected for Cloudflare; note which IP was scanned.  
  Remediation: If origin testing required, test the origin server directly or adjust scanning IP.
- Server header: cloudflare (info): traffic proxied; ensure CDN edge config is secure.  
  Remediation: review CDN security settings, WAF rules.
- Internal IP found in cookies / set-cookie: information disclosure.  
  Remediation: remove internal/origin IPs from cookies, use opaque identifiers, enable HttpOnly/Secure.
- Missing X-Frame-Options: vulnerable to clickjacking.  
  Remediation: add X-Frame-Options: DENY or SAMEORIGIN or implement CSP frame-ancestors.
- Missing X-Content-Type-Options: risk of MIME sniffing.  
  Remediation: add X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff.
- Root redirects to HTTPS: positive (redirect present).  
  Remediation: enable HSTS, validate TLS config.
- Uncommon header 'proxy-status' exposing error: information leakage.  
  Remediation: remove diagnostic headers at edge/CDN; sanitize error messages.

## Recommended quick remediation priorities
- Critical (24–72 hrs): exposed credentials, info leakage enabling access.  
- High (7 days): missing security headers on internet-facing services, sensitive disclosures.  
- Medium/Low: schedule in normal patch cycle.

## Reporting checklist
- Target URL/IP and scanned IP, date/time, nikto version, command used.  
- Attach raw output: nikto_results.txt (kept in repository).  
- Executive summary with top 5 findings and impact.  
- Findings table: severity | path | description | remediation | verification.  
- Re-scan date and acceptance criteria.

## Useful follow-ups
- Validate TLS with SSL Labs and fix weak ciphers.  
- Run focused scans (tuning) and authenticated scans where applicable.  
- Integrate Nikto runs into scheduled CI/CD or periodic security scans.  
- Track remediation in ticketing system and verify by re-scanning.
